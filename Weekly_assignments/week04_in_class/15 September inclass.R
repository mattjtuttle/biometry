#Inclass and homework for the week.



# In an effort to keep up with rising starfruit demand, you begin taking measurements of yields of fruit from individual plants. Below is data of fruit mass in grams from each plant.
fruit.mass.g<-c(9.98,37.87,16.72,9.83,6.01,30.08,59.23,8.15,246.81,8.2,0.12,3.52,218.36,73.75,5.99,2.63,155.61,3.85,90.17,27.18,8.88,6.5,1.39,234.51,1.07,22.94,3,0.82,0.6,551.9,14.59,21.63,50.24,126.92,5.3,35.75,2.11,411.13,142.95,10.27)


#1. Use a histogram to look at the shape of your fruit mass data.


#2. Log transform the data and use a histogram to look at the shape of your fruit mass data.


#3. Calculate the 95% CI and provide the answer in grams. (Hint: think about how your data is transformed!) 



#4 Wow! You found a super tree. It yields 754 g of starfruit. How exceptional is this tree? (What is the probability of finding that yield or greater based on the data?)
