# Does learning a second language change brain structure? Machelli et al. (2004) tested 22 native Italian speakers who had learned English as a second language. Proficiencies in reading, writing, and speech were assessed by a proficiency score. Gray matter density was measured in the left inferior parietal region of the brain using a neuroimaging technique, as mm^3 of gray matter per voxel. Read in the Brains.csv table:


#1.  Calculate the correlation between second language proficiency and gray matter density.


#2. Test the null hypothesis when theta = 0


#3. What is the 83% confidence around your estimate of rho?


#4. Build a general linear model of the data where proficency score predicts brain matter. Which factor is all of the error confined to?


#5. Theory predicts that the slope should be 0.04. Test this statistical hypothesis.


#6. How much variation in gray matter density does your model explain?
